        the relationship between Potential (V) and Current Density (A/cm2).
        The x-axis is labeled 'Current Density (A/cm2)' and ranges from
        0.0000001 to 0.1. The y-axis is labeled 'Potential (V)' and ranges
        from -2.5 to 1.5. There are six different data series represented
        by different colors: blue (10g), red (4g), green (6g), purple (2g),
        orange (Control), and light blue (8g). The data points for each series
        show how the potential changes with varying current density.\"\n}",

    "text": "The table consists of 6 rows and 7 columns. The columns represent
        inhibitor concentration (g), bc (V/dec), ba (V/dec), Ecorr (V), icorr
        (A/cm\u00b2), polarization resistance (\u03a9), and corrosion rate
        (mm/year). As the inhibitor concentration increases, the corrosion
        rate generally decreases, indicating the effectiveness of the
        inhibitor. Notably, the polarization resistance increases with higher
        inhibitor concentrations, peaking at 6 grams before slightly
        decreasing. This suggests that the inhibitor is most effective at
        6 grams, significantly reducing the corrosion rate and increasing
        polarization resistance. The data provides valuable insights into the
        optimal concentration of the inhibitor for corrosion prevention.",
